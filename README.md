#  Checkpoint 3: Asset Tracking


Console App created for Week 3 assignment at Lexicon.

-----

This app creates a list of Company Assets. You can add Assets (Computer or Mobile) and view the list, it shows if any of the assets you have added are close to their End Of Life cycle by 3 (marked in red) or 6 (marked in yellow) months. The app makes a call to a public API for exchange rates, used to get the price of the asset in the local currency of the office location.
